## Problem Statement

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

## Solution
My focus in this solution was on the Wine Product. I used EDA to investigate customer behavior (i.e. their attributes), so that the company would know which customers to recommend the wine product to in the next advertisement. However, as a result of the insights I received from my EDA, I was able to reach the following conclusions:

## Conclusion
So, based on our EDA, we might say that if a company were to market a new wine product to its customers. They should target each segment of customers based on the following:
* The customer Education background (Either graduate or Under graduate) -- Customers With Graduate level of education tends to buy more wines as this affect their income (i.e they tend to earn more money)
* The income of each customers (Customer who earn much tends to buy Wines)
* Age Feature: Customers below 100 years tends to Buy wines
* Kidhome: Whether a customer has kid or not: Customer who don't have kid buy wines a lot: This could be because maybe wines could intoxicate thier children.![headway-5QgIuuBxKwM-unsplash](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73393430/177591914-cdd8544e-284d-4d7b-aa71-1fcbeaeaf749.jpg)

* Date Customer joined. Old customers tend to patronize the company
* Whether a customer complain or not: Customer who dont complain buys a lot of wines than those who complain.

To put it in a more story sense:
The company should target old customers who has higher pay income, their educational level is of graduate.Also their age is below 100 years and as well they dont have children at home and they haven't complain at all.
